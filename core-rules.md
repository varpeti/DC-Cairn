# Core Rules

## Attributes

Each of the three Attributes are used in different circumstances.

- **Strength (STR)**: Used for actions requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for actions requiring poise, speed, reflexes, dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.
- **Willpower (WIL)**: Used for actions to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate spells, etc.

These are not universal descriptors. A character with a low **STR** is not necessarily hopelessly weak; they can still attempt to lift a heavy door or survive a deadly fight! Their risk is simply higher.

## Hit Protection (HP)

- It reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. It does not indicate a character’s health or fortitude, nor do they lose it for very long. See [Healing & Recovery](/core-rules#healing-and-recovery).
- If an attack would take a PC's HP exactly or under 0, the player must roll on the [**Scars**](#scars) table.

## Inventory

- Characters have a total of ten inventory slots but can only carry four or five items comfortably without the help of bags, backpacks, horses, carts, etc.
- Each Player Character (PC) starts with a **Backpack** that can hold up to six slots of items or **Fatigue**. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can make a huge difference in how much a PC can bring with them on an adventure. **Hirelings** can also be paid to carry equipment.
- Inventory is abstract, dependent only on the fiction as adjudicated by the Warden. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP. A character cannot fill more than ten slots.

### Inventory Slots

- Most items take up one slot unless otherwise indicated.
- _Petty_ items do not take up any slots. _Bulky_ items take up **two** slots.
- A bag of coins worth less than 100gp is _petty_ and does not occupy a slot.

## Actions

When a Character tries to do something which can _Succeed_ or _Fail_, the Warden asks them to make a roll for it.

- The Character's Player describes or role-play the action their character wants to take.
- The Warden then:
  - Chose a [Difficulty Class (DC)](#difficulty-class-dc) if it is not a [Contested Check (CC)](#contested-check-cc)
  - Propose the [Attribute](#attributes) based on the description/role-play
  - Propose the [Object Dice](#object-dice), if applicable
  - Then gives [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage), based on the situation
- The Character's Player then rolls, calculates the result `(1d20) + (Attribute) + (Object Dice)`, then tells the Warden.
- The Warden then compares the results:
  - If it is greater than the [DC](#difficulty-class-dc) or [CC](#contested-check-cc) it is a **Success**
  - If it is lower than the [DC](#difficulty-class-dc) or [CC](#contested-check-cc) it is a **Fail**
  - If it is equal, then always the Player Character **Succeed**
- For Natural 1 and Natural 20 on the d20 die: The Warden describes what extraordinary things happens.
- When appropriate, use the [Object Dice](#object-dice) to calculate further things, (Eg: Damage of an attack: `Attacker's Weapon Dice`)

### Example: Attack and Defence

- Ael'Onor (PC): I want to Attack Bo'Mack with my Two-Handed, Recently Sharpened Axe:
- Warden: Then that would be contested by Bo'Mack:
  - Use your STR as modifier
  - Roll with +1 Adv because he is occupied with another attacker
  - Use Axe's dice to the roll, you can throw it with Adv because it is sharp
- Ael'Onor Then I'll Attack with...
  - Rolls the dice, adds the modifiers
  - ... 28
- Warden: So Ael'Onor tries to Attack Bo'Mack
- Warden: And Bo'Mack (NPC) will contest it, and tries to block the attack.
- Warden: It is a CC and the DD is already set.
- Warden: Bo'Mack tries to block the attack by its shield
  - Bo'Mack will use STR as modifier
  - Bo'Mack will add the Heater's Dice to the roll
  - Bo'Mack will roll without Adv or DisAdv
- Warden: Then for Bo'Mack's roll...
  - Rolls the dice, adds the modifiers
  - ... 21
- Warden: So Ael'Onor rolled 28, 6 on the Axe Die, Bo'Mack rolled 21 and has 1 armor
- Warden: Bo'Mack suffers 5 damage, Ael'Onor, describe how you attacked Bo'Mack.
- Ael'Onor: _describing the successful attack_

### Example: Save

- Warden: So Ael'Onor, as you seek through the Old Mage's room, you step on a lose block, suddenly with a loud creek the ceiling opens and a big boulder drops on you, what are you doing next?
- Ael'Onor: I quickly check the source of the loud sound, and when I see the boulder failing on to me, I try to dodge it.
- Warden: Okey then, in this case:
  - Writes down the DC (24)
  - Use AGI to check if you notices it in time, can dodge it,
  - Roll with +1 DisAdv because you were not careful during the search
- Ael'Onor: Then I'll roll...
  - Rolls the dice, adds the modifiers
  - ... 12 and I rolled a Natural 1
- Warden: So the DC is 24, you rolled 12 (with Nat1)
- Warden: You failed to notice the boulder in time, you had no chance to dodge it, and it fallen directly onto you. It is a heavy boulder, so you suffer 3 damage.
- Warden: Also while you are busy being flattened, the old mechanism of this trap fails, and a sharp piece falls directly on to your face. It deals 1 more damage.

</details>

## Object Dice

Objects can have die or dice, based on how a Character wants to use it. For example each Weapon, and Shield has a dice, but a fist hitting a face can have a dice as well (usually d4)

These dice are usually between d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, based on the object and the situation.

The dice is rolled to check if an [Action](#actions) Succeed or Fail, and can be used to determine the outcome. (Eg: Damage dealt, Number of Dwarven Beer chugged in a minute)

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Based on the situation each die can have multiple Advantage or Disadvantage.

- N **Advantage**: Roll N+1 dice and take the highest result
- N **Disadvantage**: Roll N+1 dice and take the lowest result

+1 Advantage and +1 Disadvantage will cancel each other out.

## Difficulty Class (DC)

- It represents how difficulty to do an [Action](#actions).
- Around 20 is normal, below is easier, above is harder.
- This is set by the Warden for each DC roll. And the Warden can decide to not reveal it.

## Contested Check (CC)

- When two Character are trying to oppose each other, they are both rolling for [Action](#actions)
- This can be anything from attacking and defending, through to check whichever can drink more, to anything that can be contested.

## Saves

A Save is a roll to avoid negative outcomes.

- The Warden describes the situation.
- The Character's Player describes or role-play what [Action](#actions) they try to do to avoid or mitigate the situation.

## Healing and Recovery

- Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP but may leave the party exposed. Bandages can stabilize a character that has taken critical damage.
- Attribute loss (see [Critical Damage](#critical-damage)) can usually be restored with a week's rest, facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise.
- Some healing services are free, while magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.

## Deprivation and Fatigue

- A PC that lacks a crucial need (such as food or rest) is **Deprived**. Anyone **Deprived** for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. A **Deprived** PC cannot recover HP, Attributes, or item slots from **Fatigue**.
- A PC may also be forced to add **Fatigue** after casting spells or due to events occurring in the fiction. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until the PC is able to recuperate (such as with a full night’s rest in a safe spot).
- If a character is forced to add **Fatigue** to their inventory but they have no free slots, they must drop an item from their inventory.

## Armor

- Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls.
- Armor provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is worn. Some may also provide additional benefits, depending on the fiction.
- A PC, NPC, or monster cannot have more than 3 Armor.

## Hirelings

- Adventuring parties can recruit hirelings, relying on their unique skills, knowledge, and training to aid in expeditions.
- To create a hireling, choose an appropriate role from the [Hirelings](/marketplace#hirelings-per-day) table in the Marketplace. Roll 3d6 for each [Attribute](#attributes) and 1d6 for their [HP](#hit-protection-hp). Give them **equipment** appropriate to their station, then roll on the [Character Traits](/character-creation.md#character-traits-d10) tables to further flesh them out.
- Alternatively, choose an appropriate [**background**](/character-creation.md#backgrounds) and **name** from the [Character Creation](/character-creation.md) guide. Roll (or choose from) the tables for that background. Then roll for Rations, Gold Pieces, Attributes, HP, and age.

## Die of Fate

- Optionally, roll 1d6 whenever the outcome of an event is uncertain or to simulate an element of randomness and chance.
- A roll of 4 or more generally favors the PCs, while a roll of 3 or under usually means bad luck for the PCs.

## Combat

### Basic units

- 1 Action Point (AP) = 3 sec
- 1 Round in combat = 2 Minutes
- 1 Space = 1.5 meter = 5 feet

### Initiative roll

- Each creature rolls an initiative roll (`1d20 + **WIL**`)
- The initiative is sorted from largest to lowest, for each Group separately.
- Turns are arranged so that each Group takes one Turn at a time, so when a member of one Group takes a Turn, they’re followed by a member of an other Group taking a Turn. This continue rotating until each member of each Group has taken a Turn.

### Turn

- Each Creature (usually) has 4 Action Point (AP) (About 12 second to act / turn)
  - Surprised Creatures have only 2 AP until their first turn ends.
- Each Creature can use the APs to do [Actions](#actions). [Saves](#saves) are (usually) not using AP.
  - The Warden decides the AP cost of a described Action based on how long it takes.
- Each Creature regains its maximum AP at their end of turn. (Tip: Use all of your AP, before the end of your turn)

### Attacking & Damage

- The attacker describes the [Attack](#actions) they want to do, the target(s) describes their [Defense](#actions). It it hits:
  - The result of the Attacker [Object Dice](#object-dice) minus the Target Armor is the damage.
  - Subtract it from the Target's [HP](#hit-protection-hp)
- If an attack would take the [HP](#hit-protection-hp) exactly or under 0, refer to the [Critical Damage](#critical-damage) section.
  - If it is a PC's refer to the [Scars](#scars-table) table to see how they are uniquely impacted.

### Critical Damage

- Damage that reduces a Target's HP below zero is subtracted _from their STR_ by the amount of damage remaining. The target must then immediately make a _STR_ [Save](#saves) (DC=15) to avoid taking **Critical Damage**, using their _new STR score_. On a success, the target is still in the fight (albeit with a lower _STR_ score) and must continue to make Critical Damage Saves when incurring damage.
- Any PC that suffers Critical Damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid (such as bandages), they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour. NPCs and monsters that fail a Critical Damage Save are considered dead, per the **Warden's** discretion. Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a Critical Damage Save.

### Attribute Loss

- If a PC's **STR** is reduced to 0, they die. If their **DEX** is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their **WIL** is reduced to 0, they are delirious. Complete **DEX** and **WIL** loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.

### Character Death

- When a character dies, the player should create a new character or take control of a hireling. They can immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.

### Detachments

- Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single _Detachment_. When a _detachment_ takes **Critical Damage**, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.
- Attacks against detachments by individuals are with [Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage) (excluding _blast_ damage).
- Attacks against individuals by detachments are with [Advantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).

### Retreat

- Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful _DEX_ [Save](#saves), as well as a safe destination to run to.

### Ranged Attacks

- Ranged weapons can target any enemy near enough to see the whites of their eyes. Attacks against especially distant targets are with [Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
- Ammunition is not tracked unless otherwise specified.

### Special Actions in Combat

- Move (1 AP): You can move up to your 1/3 **DEX** rounded up +1 Spaces until your end of turn. (1 Space = 1.5 meter) (`CEIL(DEX/3)+1`)
- Gain Advantage (1 AP): You can add [Advantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage) for your d20 for the next [Action](#actions) roll. Can be used multiple times.
- Held Action (X AP): You describe an [Action](#actions) and the condition(s), and when the condition(s) are met, the [Action](#actions) happens.
  - If the condition is not met until your next turn, the held action cancels.
  - Now: Use the AP for the Action(s). Decide the modifiers, Object Dice, Advantage(s) and Disadvantage(s) with the Warden.
  - When then Action happens: Use the other resources your Action requires, then roll for the Action.

## Scars

If damage to a PC would reduce their HP to 0 or under, look up the result on the [Scars Table](#scars-table), based on _how much HP the PC had before the last attack_

<details markdown="block"><summary>Expand for Examples</summary>

- If a PC went from 3 HP to 0 HP, they would look at entry #3 (Walloped).
- If a PC went from 3 HP to -1 HP, they would look at the entry #3 (Walloped).
- If a PC went from 4 HP to 2 HP, then in another attack to -4 HP, they look at the entry #2 (Rattling Blow).

</details>

## Magic

Spells are a special kind of Spirits, they usually entrapped in a [Grimoire](#grimoire) or [Spell Scroll](#spell-scrolls).
They are sentient, and they want to be free. When someone cast a spell, its mind interacts with the spirit's will, and that creates Magical effects.

### Grimoire

- You can carry a **Grimoire** worth 300gp. It is [bulky](#inventory-slots), and it contains the spells.
- For the spell list refer to [Spell List](/spells.md#spell-list)

### Mana Dust

- Mana dust can be used instead of Inventory slot to for **Magic Dice** (d6). In this way, the used Mana dust cannot produce fatigue.

### Casting Spells:

- Holding your **Grimoire** in both hands, choose a spell. The description may denote the spell's duration with **D** and range with **R**.
- You have an amount of **Magic Dice** (d6) equal to the amount of available [inventory slots](#inventory-slots) and [Mana Dust](#mana-dust).
  - Choose how many you wish to invest (up to a maximum of 4).
    - Spells will refer to these as `[dice]`.
    - Some spells will refer to their `[sum]` as well.
- Roll `[dice]`. For each inventory slot die that shows a 4-6, you gain one [Fatigue](#deprivation-and-fatigue).
- If you get 2 matches (Eg: two dice rolled 4), something has gone very wrong. Look up the spell's `[sum]` on the [Mishaps](#mishaps) table below for what happens next.
- If you get 3 matches or more (Eg: 3 dice rolled 5), something has gone terribly wrong,
  - The spell you tried to cast, and failed, escapes your **Grimoire** and becomes a spirit.
  - Based on the matching faces, it is:
    - 1-2 Hostile
    - 3-4 Neutral
    - 4-5 Friendly
  - Roll a random spell on the [Spell List](/spells.md#spell-list) table. The Spirit becomes this spell, but keeps the original spell in its essence as well.
  - Roll for 2d6 [HP](#hit-protection-hp), and [Attribute](#attributes), no armor, but physical attacks are with [Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage)
  - You lose the spell from your Grimoire.

<details markdown="block"> <summary>Expand for an Example</summary>

#### **Example**

_**Barry** has 2 free inventory slots and 2 Mana Dust, giving him 4 **Magic Dice**. He selects the spell **Mirror Image**:_

**Mirror Image**: [dice] illusory duplicates of yourself appear under your control.

_He decides to invest 2 Mana Dust and 1 Inventory slot to his **Magic Dice**. That means he can create **three** duplicates that last for **thirty** minutes each.

He rolls: double 2s and a 5. The spell effects occur, and he takes one [Fatigue](#deprivation-and-fatigue). However, he also rolled a **series**, meaning a Mishap has occurred as well. He gets the `[sum]` of the dice - 9 - and looks up the effect on the Mishaps table._

</details>

### Spell Scrolls

- Scrolls contain a single spell and are destroyed after a single use. Otherwise, they work exactly the same as spells recorded in your **Grimoire**.

### Copying Spells

- You may copy spells found in Scrolls to your **Grimoire**.
- It costs 50gp for the gold inks and takes 6 hours to complete, reduced by `[sum]` hours.
- The Scroll is destroyed in the process.

### **Creating a Grimoire**

Creating a **Grimoire** is time-consuming and expensive. You will need:

- A single Scroll, which is sacrificed through the process.
- 200gp in inks, as well as a blank book.
- 6 hours of undisturbed labor in the light of a full moon. Afterwards, you are [deprived](#deprivation-and-fatigue).
- The spell contained within the Scroll becomes the first recorded spell.

### Copying from on Grimoire to another

It is not impossible but close to impossible

- Free the spirit from a Grimoire (by rolling 3 or more matching faces)
- Kill the spirit, and collect its dust
- Use 100gb worth of Golden Ink to write it to the new Grimoire.
- It takes 6 hours of undisturbed labor in a place where the Magic is the strongest
- Roll 1d4:
  - 1: Fail
  - 2-5: The Spirits Spell is captured in the **Grimoire**
  - 6: Both the Spirit's spell and the original spell its created from captured in the **Grimoire**

| 8           | Deafened: You cannot hear anything until you find extraordinary aid. Regardless, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d4.                                                                              |

| 10          | Sundered: An appendage is torn off, crippled, or useless. (The Warden will tell you which.) Then make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d6.                                                              |
| 11          | Mortal Wound: You are deprived and out of action. You die in one hour unless healed. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max HP.                                                                         |
| 12          | Doomed: Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived. If your next save against critical damage is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |

| 4       | There is a chain reaction to the spell (the Warden will say how). Take an additional Fatigue.|
| 5       | The Spell's effects are reversed; the Warden will tell you how. Take an additional Fatigue.|
| 6       | Any objects in your inventory that are not made of metal instantly combust. You are now immune to fire for short bursts.|
| 7       | You are [deprived](#deprivation-and-fatigue). After recovery, roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.|
| 8       | You take 1d4 _WIL_ damage when casting spells for the next 24 hours. Afterwards roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max WIL, take the new result.|
| 9       | The spell turns your skin a dark shade of purple, and makes you invisible in the moonlight. Your eyes however glow a bright yellow at night.|
| 10      | You become insubstantial for 1d4 hours as your spirit leaves your body, which remains unconscious. You can fly and pass through walls, but not touch anything. Also, no one can see or hear you through mundane means.|
| 11      | You suffer horrible arcane burns; lose 1d4 _WIL_. From now on you can use +1 **Magic Dice** for free (up to the limit) (use a die of a different color). If it results in a 4-6 you lose 1 WIL.|
| 12      | The spell backfires; you lose 1 inventory slot (scratch it off your sheet). You are now surrounded by a magical essence that provides +1 Armor (normal limits still apply).|
| 13      | Your **Grimoire** is damaged and unusable. Creating a new **Grimoire** from its remains restores the original spells as well.|
| 14      | Instead of Fatigue, the spell causes magical tumors to fill their respective slots. They can only be removed by a specialized healer. Upon recovery, you are able to ignore a single Fatigue taken from spellcasting. If the spell did not cause Fatigue, you are [deprived](/cairn-srd/#deprivation--fatigue).|
| 15      | Arcane energies wrack your body as a piece of your soul is transferred into your **Grimoire**. You lose half your WIL (rounded down). Your **Grimoire** now appears in any form you wish and takes no space in inventory. It cannot be destroyed except by your own death, and vice-versa.|
| 16      | You permanently lose 1d4 STR as the spell interacts with nearby plant life, which rips out of the earth and fuses against your skin. You have +1 Armor, although fire does enhanced damage against you. You can only feed by photosynthesis.|
| 17      | You are transformed into something weird and unnatural (the Warden will say exactly how). Others will have difficulty looking at you. If someone doesn't focus on you, you are invisible. You fail any attempts at persuasion.|
| 18      | One your hands becomes fused with your **Grimoire**. You can never let go of it, however it only takes up 1 inventory slot. You can fire a bolt of arcane energy from that hand that deals 1d6 damage. If your hand is cut off, you can never cast spells again.|
| 19      | Large ugly wings sprout from your back, ripping through whatever you are wearing. You gain 1d4 _DEX_ and can fly. You cannot wear armor or a backpack, and have a only 5 inventory slots.|
| 20      | You dimensionally swap limbs with a magical being from an alien plane. Gain its properties (ask the Warden), both good and bad. Also: it's coming for you, and it's mad as hell. |
| 21      | An extra-planar deity senses your arcane power (ask the Warden which). You are now linked, and can call on it for aide. It can likewise ask you for help, and punish you for non-compliance. Good luck.|
| 22      | Your body becomes a vessel of pure magical energy. You no longer need to consume food, water or air. Fatigue and Mishaps from casting spells does not affect you, but instead you lose 1d4 STR on a result of 5-6. At STR 0 you become a spell (ask the Warden which). You can smell magic.|
| 23      | You create an exact duplicate of yourself. One grows older while the other grows younger. Both age at at the rate of 1 year per day. Your thoughts are joined, and if one dies so does the other. Only magical aide will restore you; afterward add +1d6 to each ability score.|
| 24      | You have become Elemental. Create a **True Name** for yourself. Magical energies surround you at all times, and mundane attacks against you are with +1 Disadvantage. If someone learns your **True Name**, they can control you. Other Elementals will come for you.|
